Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Writing Conventions

**No em-dashes. Ever.**

Never use an em-dash (the `—` character) anywhere: not in code, comments, strings, UI copy, docs, config, or commit messages. Rephrase instead with a colon, comma, parentheses, or two sentences. Do not substitute an en-dash either. This applies to the whole codebase, not just user-facing copy.

**No AI attribution in commits.**

Never add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer (or any Claude/Anthropic attribution) to commit messages. The author is always samuelreichor.

## 7. Comments

**Default: no comment. A comment must say something the code cannot.**

Allowed: a non-obvious WHY (a constraint, a bug being worked around, a surprising invariant), kept to one or two lines, placed where the reader would otherwise be confused.

Never write:
- Comments that restate the code, the name, or the type (`webserver: string | null // e.g. 'nginx-fpm'`)
- A header paragraph above every function, component, field, route, or ref
- History or provenance ("legacy", "before X existed", "increment 2", "kept for compatibility"): that belongs in an ADR or the commit message
- Section dividers (`// ── validation ──`)
- Comments that describe UI behavior the template already shows
- Comments explaining what the next few lines do when a well-named function would do it
- Comments explaining how a platform mechanism works (Teleport, fixed positioning, a watcher, a cascade, an index). The reader knows Vue, Nuxt, SQLite and the browser; only say what is specific to THIS code

Test: delete the comment. If the reader loses nothing, it should not exist. When you touch a file, do not add comments to code you did not change, and do not remove existing ones unless asked.
